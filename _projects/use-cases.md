A “use case” here is a brief scenario describing what a scholar, teacher, student, or general reader would do in a workspace like Melville ReMix: it sets goals, earmarks procedure, indicates desired results. MEL editors have contributed the following use cases.

### FOR SCHOLARS:

-   For a project on Civil War poetry and journalism, use Battle-Pieces edition to track Melville’s use of the  _Rebellion Record_.
-   Use MEL’s  _Versions of Moby-Dick_ and MELCat art to study ekphrasis in  _Moby-Dick_.
-   Drawing on  _Melville’s Marginalia Online_, explore Melville’s revision of sources in any of his works.
-   Examine Melville’s geographical imagination by sorting places he wrote about but never visited in comparison to sites he visited.
-   Sort Melville Family Correspondence to establish lines of networking.
-   Compare episodes in  _Moby-Dick_  to their corresponding scenes in film.
-   Use Melville ReMix to demonstrate how a single scene from a film version of Moby-Dick draws from passages in different chapters of the book, by linking tagged passages to the transcription of a video scene from the film.
-   Compare tagged passages other Melville works, say Typee, and compare them side-by-side with related passages in Moby-Dick to demonstrate the growth of an idea in Melville’s writing career.

### FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS:

-   Invite students to participate in any of the scholarly projects in MEL.
-   Use MEL Projects to build teaching units involving single or multiple Melville works.
-   Use TextLab to transcribe passages in the  _Billy Budd_  manuscript and compose Revision Narratives.
-   Use Itinerary to map routes in Melville’s novels (such as  _Typee_,  _Moby-Dick_,  _Pierre_,  _Israel Potter_) or the short stories (such as “Bartleby,” “The Encantadas”)
-   Compare versions of  _Moby-Dick_  to study Victorian era censorship and expurgation
-   Use Annotation Studio to collaborate on contextual editing of chapters, stories, or poems
-   Compare the text of Moby-Dick side by side with texts from which it draws influence, such as Paradise Lost and The Bible.
-   Use Melville ReMix to tag one’s annotations of regarding “Ahab’s Madness” in several categories: “historical conception of madness,” “Ahab's psyche,” “imagery of madness,” etc. A category is selected, all passages tagged under that category can be viewed together.

### FOR GENERAL READERS:

-   Create a discussion site for a book group, with opportunities for annotating chapters and adding images, map routes.
-   Create a podcast or presentation enabling users to interact with Melville related materials.
