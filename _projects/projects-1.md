As a long-term editorial project slated for completion in 2030, MEL has developed its editorial platform, tools, and community, as well as an affiliation with  \[Hofstra’s Digital Research Center (DRC)\]([http://hofstradrc.org/](http://hofstradrc.org/ "http://hofstradrc.org/"))  to ensure sustainability for its editions. So far, we have launched three “model” editions:  _Versions of Moby-Dick_,  _Versions of_ _Battle-Pieces_, and  _Versions of Billy Budd_. To learn more about why we chose these three works for our model editions, go to  \[Versions of Melville\]([https://mel.hofstra.edu/versions-of-melville.html](https://mel.hofstra.edu/versions-of-melville.html "https://mel.hofstra.edu/versions-of-melville.html")). Given the nature of digital editing, we will be augmenting these editions periodically with new content and updates.

**At the same time**, we are working on new editions: Melville’s first and most popular book  _Typee_, his literary manifesto “Hawthorne and His Mosses,” his three travel Journals (1849, 1856-67, and 1860), and Melville’s Letters and Family Correspondence.
