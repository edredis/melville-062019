_Billy Budd_  is Melville's last and perhaps his second most familiar work of fiction. As with  _Moby-Dick_, the novella has devoted readerships in academe, the arts, and the popular culture. It has been the center of critical controversies regarding political resistance and Christian acceptance, authority and duty, masculinity and beauty, fathers and sons, romance and irony, and Melville biography. It continues to be a seminal text in fields of literary study worldwide, including law, war, gender, sexuality, and the editing of manuscripts.
