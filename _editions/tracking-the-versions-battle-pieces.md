Though Melville had begun writing poetry early in life—and evidence suggests that poetry, not prose, was the form he aspired to—the writer began in the late-1850s to re-tool himself as a serious poet and to compose poems for publication. By 1860, he had enough roughage for a collection titled  _Poems_, but abandoned the project after his submission to Harpers was rejected.

_Battle-Pieces_  _and Aspects of the War_  (1866) is the first of Melville’s four published volumes of poetry. The 72 poems treat events leading to and following the war, dated battles throughout the war, over a dozen “Inscriptions” of a memorial nature, and a prose Supplement arguing for acceptance. Several poems include prose endnotes, similar to the prose headnotes Melville would include in later poetic works, found in  _John Marr_, the unpublished  _Weeds & Wildings_, and the  _Billy Budd_  manuscript.

“With few exceptions,” the bulk of the  _Battle-Pieces_  poems were written, according to Melville’s preface, “in an impulse imparted by the fall of Richmond,” on 3 April 1865. Taking him at his word, we can imagine the writer spending the following eighteen months researching, composing, revising, discarding, and sorting out the order of the poems that survived his creative process. Among the source books available to him for his research were Robert Tomes  _The War with the South_  (1865), Evert Duyckinck’s  _National History of the War for the Union_  (1862-1865), Putnam’s  _Rebellion Record_ (1862-1868)—a monthly compilation of documents also collected in annual volumes—and illustrated coverage of the war in  _Harper’s Weekly Magazine_.

Some indication that Melville had secured  _Harpers_  as a publisher for  _Battle-Pieces_  is that, during this period of productivity, Melville published five of his Civil War poems in  _Harper’s New Monthly Magazine_  (one in each month from February to July 1866), before the publication of  _Battle-Pieces_  in Fall 1866.

-   “The March to the Sea” (February 1866)
-   “The Cumberland” (March)
-   “Philip” [“Sheridan at Cedar Creek”] (April)
-   “Chattanooga” (June)
-   “Gettysburg” (July)

A sixth Civil War poem—“Inscription for the Slain [Dead] at Fredericksburgh”—appeared two years earlier in Alexander Bliss and John P. Kennedy’s 1864 benefit anthology  _Autograph Leaves from Our Country’s Authors_. However, Melville did not include this piece among his other memorial verse in  _Battle-Pieces_. The only known  _Battle-Pieces_  manuscript is a fair-copy transcription of “Philip” that retains that title but also contains wording that appears in the book version of the poem, re-titled “Sheridan at Cedar Creek.” These details suggest that the manuscript is an “intermediate” version of the text, between magazine and book publication (NN _Published Poems_  583).

An inveterate reviser, Melville tinkered with some of his  _Battle-Pieces_  poems in proofs before the volume’s Fall 1866 publication and tinkered again after they were published in his personal copy of  _Battle-Pieces_. Evidence of these pencil revisions appear in two physical versions of  _Battle-Pieces_, both located at Harvard's Houghton Library and designated Copy A and Copy C. The personal, Copy A of the book has several checkmarks in the table of contents and three revisions, on pages 23, 27, and 129. Copy C is a bound set of page proofs, or as Melville's wife put it in her inscription on the front binder's leaf: "'Revised' sheets—with / Herman's corrections." According the NN edition of Melville's  _Published Poems_, these pages contain changes at 49 points in the book (584).

Other post-publication versions of selected poems may not have involved Melville’s input, but they are concrete evidence of Melville’s reception as a poet and of what 19th-century publishers chose to select from his work for consumption by differing readerships within a culture. Melville’s “Sheridan” poem is one of a handful of Melville poems that was reprinted in numerous newspapers under various titles (e.g. “Sheridan’s Ride”) and, more tellingly, in at least three anthologies during his lifetime (NN  _Published Poems_  585). Poems included in these compilations are
