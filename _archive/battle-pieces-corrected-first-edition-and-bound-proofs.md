/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0023.jpg){:class="pull-right-md-3 col-xs-2"} Melville's revisions appear in two physical versions of Battle-Pieces, both located at Harvard's Houghton Library and designated Copy A and Copy C. The former is a personal copy of the book with several check marks in the table of contents and three revisions, on pages 23, 27, and 129. Copy C is a bound set of pages for proofing, or as Melville's wife put it in her inscription on the front binder's leaf: "'Revised' sheetsâ€”with / Herman's corrections." According the the NN edition of Melville's Published Poems, these pages contain changes at 49 points in the book (584).

In the side-by-side display below, the pull-down beneath each frame is a table of contents of poems.  Pages with penciled inscriptions are also given and noted with an asterisk [*].
